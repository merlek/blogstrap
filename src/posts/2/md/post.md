Morning reading
---------------

This morning I was reading in Hebrews. In my opinion, Hebrews is one of the best books of the
New Testament. It is packed full of rich theology and crucial truths. It establishes Christ as
the supreme high priest, and his death as the necessary and effective payment for sin. “For by
a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14
ESV). This is just one of the many life-giving statements in Hebrews.

In the latter half of chapter 10, we come to a favorite quotable

> Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is
> faithful.And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not
> neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all
> the more as you see the Day drawing near.
> 
> (Hebrews 10:24-25 ESV)

Great verses. Now the verses that follow after are not as well known.

For…
----

It begins with “For”. This means that the following is related to what preceded it. What
follows is a reason for holding fast and encouraging. What follows are the consequences of not
holding fast and encouraging one another.

> For if we go on sining deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no
> longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgement, and a fury of
> fire that will consume the adversaries.
>
> (Hebrews 10:26−27 ESV)

It continues.

> Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three
> witnesses. How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has
> trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he
> was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, “Vengeance
> is mine; I will repay.” And again, “The Lord will judge his people.” It is a fearful thing
> to fall into the hands of the living God.
>
> (Hebrews 10:28−31 ESV)

Take a moment and let this sink in. If I go on willfully sinning, there no longer remains a
sacrifice for sins, but fearful judgement. Anyone who puts aside the law dies without mercy.
How much worse off are those who trampled underfoot the Son of God? Vengeance is the Lord’s.

### Deliberate Sin

This is absolutely terrifying. Earlier in chapter 6 it speaks of those that go on in sin.

> For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted
> the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the
> word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them
> again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm
> and holding him up to contempt.
>
> (Hebrews 6:4−6 ESV)

There have been times in my life where I’ve found myself in deliberate, willful sin. I knew
that it was wrong. I knew I shouldn’t have done it. But I did it anyway. Now, after reading
these passages, I feel hopeless. Have I disqualified myself from salvation? Is there any hope
for my redemption? God please come to me and make me right! I pray, but the next day my heart
has not changed. I still desire that which I should not. Is there any hope for me, or am I
damned?

Helpless
--------

This feeling of helplessness reminds me of Romans 9. This chapter is subtitled _God’s
Sovereign Choice_ in the ESV Bible, and it is a hard chapter to swallow for some. God’s
sovereign choice is illustrated in considering Jacob and Esau.

> For this is what the promise said: “About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall
> have a son.” And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our
> forefather Isaac, though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in
> order that God’s purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him
> who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” As it is written, “Jacob I
> loved, but Esau I hated.”
> 
> What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means! For he says to Moses,
> “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have
> compassion.” So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.
> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might
> show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” So then he has
> mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
> 
> You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?” But
> who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have
> you made me like this?” Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump
> one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use? **What if God, desiring to
> show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath
> prepared for destruction**, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of
> mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory—
>
> (Romans 9:9-23 ESV)

This does not seem fair, but what can you do? Who are we to argue with God? We have to come to
accept this because it is God’s word. He picked one of the brothers and rejected the other
before they were born. He chose Jacob and hated Esau.

### What if…

Now hear me out… what if I’m not Jacob? I think that many that come to accept the passage
because they assume that in the story they’re Jacob. _What if I’m Esau?_ Just thinking about
it now, I have much more in common with Esau than I do Jacob (not that Jacob was perfect
either). Esau was the firstborn, and had the right to inherit his father’s place. He had this
birth-right, but sold it away his to feed his stomach. I’m like Esau. I grew up in a Christian
home and began hearing the gospel at a young age. I was privileged, but as I grew, I threw
away the salvation obtained by the gospel to feed my flesh. I indulged in all sin. I cheated,
lied, stole, fought, blasphemed, and committed adultery. _And I knew better_. I wasn’t a poor child
that just didn’t know any better. I knew it was wrong. I did it anyway, and I didn’t only do
those things, _I loved them._ This was me throughout most of life.

Recently I turned out. I came to a place where I realized I wasn’t happy. I had no _life_, no
_joy_. I had died. I was dead, but I could remember the joy I knew when I was young, and that
joy came from knowing God. After getting lost, God called me back. He’s worked mightily in all
things to bring me closer to him. He’s given me the right friends. He brought me to live in
the right place. He gave me time to make the right relationships and to spend time feeding on
His Word. He took away my desire for sin and He gave me new life.

More recently though, I feel I’ve stepped back. I’ve stepped back into my old skin, my old
ways. I’ve found myself again wanting what I know is wrong. I’ve been thinking about the flesh
more and found myself wanting it more. And it’s at this point that I feel helpless again. I
don’t want to want these things. I don’t want to be a vessel of wrath.

What can I do?
--------------

We seem to find an answer in another book.

> Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for
> honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good
> work.
> 
> (2 Timothy 2:21 ESV)

That sounds simple enough, but is impossible in practice. I cannot _cleanse_ myself. No matter
how hard I try, I cannot do well enough. No matter how hard I try, I can’t change my heart. I
still want what is evil. I still do what is wrong.

### The answer is Christ.

In order to want Christ, we have to see him for who he is.

> He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds
> the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at
> the right hand of the Majesty on high,
> 
> (Hebrews 1:3 ESV)

> The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious,
> slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for
> thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the
> guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children’s children, to
> the third and the fourth generation.”
> 
> (Exodus 34:6-7 ESV)

Everything that is beautiful reflects the beauty of God. Everything that is right reflects His
perfect righteousness. He is perfect justice. He is perfect love. Everyone who is kind
reflects the love and compassion of our God. He alone is worthy. He has all power and all
authority. He is worthy of our time and our praise. To know Him is fulfillment of life. To
call Him Father is to finally belong. He has prepared a place for us. He is unstained desire.
He is perfect. He is holy.

### The answer is confession.

We must confess two things.

**Confess Jesus is Lord.**

> because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that
> God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is
> justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
> 
> (Romans 10:9-10 ESV)

**Confess your sins.**

> If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
> from all unrighteousness.
> 
> (1 John 1:9 ESV)

God remains faithful even when we are faithless. Repent from sin, admit you’ve done wrong and
turn out from it, and let Jesus come into your life to be in charge. Acknowledge Jesus as
Savior and Lord, in your heart and in public. Then you can experience the fullness of life
that comes with knowing God. I no longer have to be a vessel of wrath, and neither do you.
Repent and live.
