This sickness is not unto death (John 11:4)
===========================================

_The Sickness Unto Death_ is a piece by Soren Kierkegaard. He opens his introduction with this
verse. The context is the death of Lazarus. Lazarus is a friend of Jesus' who passes away.
Christ comes later and restores him to life, but before coming, he makes the comment that the
sickness that Lazarus has is not unto death. We know that Lazarus dies, so what does it mean
that the sickness was not unto death? If death itself is not _the sickness unto death_, then is
there such a sickness? According to Kierkegaard, the answer is yes. What is it? If you plan on
reading the book, take a moment to read the introduction. It may be a little dense, but if you
can follow it is absolutely beautiful.

After the introduction, we find that the sickness unto death is _despair_. Despair is worse
than death, and is the end of man. Kierkegaard goes on to explain what is the self and what is
despair.

The self.
---------

> A human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The
> self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to
> itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to
> itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and finite, the temporal and the
> eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short a synthesis... The relation between the psychical
> and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this
> relation... is a self.

The self is two parts:

1. A relation that relates itself to itself
2. In relating itself to itself, relates itself to another

###A relation that relates itself to itself

The self is the relationship between the body and the soul and, as [Bellinger's Summary][] puts
it, "the self is conscious of itself (is aware of itself, can talk to itself, etc.)".

###In relating itself to itself, relates itself to another

God established the self, so the self relates to God.

Despair.
--------

Despair is _mis-relation_, a break in a relationship. There are three forms of despair.

1. Ignorance of having a self (more so an eternal self).
2. Not willing to be oneself (a mis-relation in the self).
3. Willing to be oneself (a mis-relation with God).

All despair can be traced to the third form, a break in relation to God. As such, despair is
chiefly a mis-relation with God.
