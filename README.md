# Compiling CSS and JavaScript

blogstrap uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)

## Installing Grunt

To install Grunt, you must **first [download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)** (which includes npm). npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

  Then, from the command line:

1.  Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2.  Navigate to the root `/bootstrap/` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at the [`package.json`](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/package.json) file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

## Available Grunt commands

### `grunt dist` (Just compile CSS and JavaScript)

Regenerates the `/dist/` directory with compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript files. As a Bootstrap user, this is normally the command you want.

### `grunt watch` (Watch)

Watches the Less source files and automatically recompiles them to CSS whenever you save a change.

### `grunt test` (Run tests)

Runs [JSHint](http://jshint.com) and runs the [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com) tests headlessly in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org).

### `grunt docs` (Build &amp; test the docs assets)

Builds and tests CSS, JavaScript, and other assets which are used when running the documentation locally via `jekyll serve`.

### `grunt` (Build absolutely everything and run tests)

Compiles and minifies CSS and JavaScript, builds the documentation website, runs the HTML5 validator against the docs, regenerates the Customizer assets, and more. Requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Usually only necessary if you're hacking on Bootstrap itself.

## Troubleshooting

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, first delete the `/node_modules/` directory generated by npm. Then, rerun `npm install`.
